# Export data from the Data lake

This document has the goal to explain how to use the export functionality.

## Why?

For instance, the data can be used in different fields on your application, a brief example is to use for data analysis. Exporting data into a CSV or JSON file, make it easier for a Data scientists to use and customize it with a python script.
Itâ€™s also a nice way to see your data without relying on third-party tools, which means, you will have locally your data in a human-readable format.

Keep in mind that we are considering that you are under Andromeda.ConsoleApp folder and using a local project. If you are using a compiled Andromeda the `run` command will be replaced to `Andromeda.ConsoleApp.dll`

### `dotnet run -- export -h`
        It will show the possible options.
