# How to get social media credentials

## Introduction

This document intends to explain how to get the social media credentials in
order to run Andromeda.

Keep in mind that just one credential is already enough to make the project run.

## Credentials folder structure

To run Andromeda, all the credentials should be placed in a specific folder
structure explained [here](./credential_folder_structure.md).

## Adwords

The official [Adwords API documentation for
.NET](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/first-api-call#set_up_oauth2_authentication)
explains how to get the Adwords credentials.

Once you have your `App.config` ready (the documentation will explain to you how
to do it), copy and paste the file into the credentials folder.

## Facebook and Instagram Credentials

You can get credentials to Facebook Pages, Facebook Marketing and Instagram
Credentials by using the Andromeda python scripts.

## YouTube

You can get credentials to YouTube Credentials in two ways: using the Andromeda python scripts or following the
The Medium article [Fetching YouTube Data using
Andromeda](https://medium.com/@insightsjellyfish/fetching-youtube-data-using-andromeda-8f1b1240803c).
We recommend to use the python script, since it cuts a lot of steps making
the process of getting the YouTube credentials easier.
